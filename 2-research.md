- <p style="font-size:14px"><b>Send Them Back? The Real Estate Consequences of Repatriations</b><br>
(with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/cortesgustavos" target="_blank"> Gustavo Cortes</a>)  <em>Version coming soon! </em></p>

   <p style="font-size:12px"><b>Abstract:</b> We examine how the repatriation of Mexican immigrants in the US from 1930 to 1936 affected housing and construction in American cities. Using US Census and hand-collected building permits data, we show that repatriating Mexicans during the Great Depression significantly slowed city growth. Employing instruments that account for the effects of the Depression, we show that cities with higher Mexican outflow experienced lower growth in commercial and residential real estate. We find significant negative effects on the number and value of building permits, as well as house values. Repatriations seem to have a long-lasting impact, leaving a footprint on local economic growth. </p>

- <b>Determinants of Bilateral Trade in Manufacturing and Services: A Unified Approach</b><br> (with <a href="https://www.satyapdas.com" target="_blank">Satya P. Das</a>) 

   <p style="font-size:12px"><b>Abstract:</b> This paper derives gravity equations for aggregate bilateral trade in manufacturing and services when preferences are non-homothetic, and there is a difference in the degree of national product differentiation between the two types of products.  Non-homotheticity implies two "non-standard" determinants of bilateral trade: per-capita income and income inequality in the importing country. In estimating gravity equations, we include two non-standard trade-cost variables, namely, internet penetration and a measure of virtual proximity (the number of bilateral hyperlinks). Our results support the theoretical predictions and reveal that virtual proximity is a strong predictor of aggregate trade in both services and manufactures. It diminishes the effect of physical distance, language difference, as well as income variables.</p>

   <p style="font-size:12px"><b>Abstract:</b> This paper estimates the impact of vessel turnaround time on Brazilian exports. To achieve this goal, we use a difference gravity equation to explore the time variation in port procedures for 16 Brazilian ports. This paper uses a unique database with local exports, taking into account the port used and products aggregated at the four‐digit Harmonized System (HS) level for the period between 2010 and 2012. The estimation results indicate that, in general, each additional hour of delay in port procedures represents costs to Brazilian exporters, which may lead to loss of competitiveness of domestic products abroad. According to the estimates, each additional relative hour of delay in the average port is equivalent to a reduction in relative local exports of ~2%. Moreover, a 10% relative reduction in vessel turnaround time can increase the proportional number of exported product categories by 1%. Therefore, our findings suggest that turnaround time has a statistically significant effect on the intensive and extensive margins of trade.</p>
